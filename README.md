Project: NYC Taxi Data Analytics & Prediction Platform
This project plan outlines the steps to build an end-to-end, cloud-native platform for analyzing and predicting trends in the NYC Taxi dataset. The architecture is serverless, automated, and leverages key AWS services for data processing, machine learning, and business intelligence.

1. Project Goal
The primary goal is to architect and implement a robust system that can:

Ingest and process millions of NYC taxi trip records efficiently.

Analyze the data to uncover insights into rider demand, fare structures, and tipping patterns.

Develop and deploy a machine learning model to predict trip durations.

Automate the entire infrastructure deployment and updates using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD best practices.

2. Solution Architecture
The platform will be built on a serverless architecture within AWS to ensure scalability, cost-efficiency, and low operational overhead.

Workflow:

Data Ingestion: Raw taxi data (in Parquet format) is downloaded from the NYC TLC website and uploaded to a "raw data" S3 bucket.

ETL & Processing: An AWS Glue crawler catalogs the raw data. A containerized Python script, running on a schedule via AWS Fargate, is triggered to perform cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering. The processed, analysis-ready data is stored in a "processed data" S3 bucket.

Data Analysis: AWS Athena is used to run ad-hoc, serverless SQL queries directly on the processed data in S3 for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Machine Learning: Amazon SageMaker accesses the processed data to train a Scikit-learn regression model that predicts trip duration. The trained model is then deployed to a SageMaker endpoint for real-time predictions.

Data Visualization: Amazon Managed Grafana connects to Athena as a data source to build interactive dashboards for business intelligence and visualizing key metrics.

Automation & IaC: Terraform is used to define and provision all the required AWS resources. GitHub Actions automates the deployment pipeline, ensuring that any changes to the code or infrastructure are tested and deployed systematically.

3. Phased Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation & Data Ingestion
Objective: Set up the core AWS infrastructure and establish the initial data lake.

Tasks:

Write Terraform scripts (main.tf) to provision:

Two S3 buckets: nyc-taxi-raw-data and nyc-taxi-processed-data.

Necessary IAM roles and policies for Glue, Fargate, and SageMaker.

Create a simple Python script to download a sample month of data from the NYC TLC website and upload it to the nyc-taxi-raw-data bucket.

Set up the initial GitHub repository and a basic GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the Terraform infrastructure.

Phase 2: ETL Processing Pipeline
Objective: Develop and deploy the automated data transformation job.

Tasks:

Write a Python script (process_data.py) using Pandas/Dask to:

Read raw Parquet files from the raw S3 bucket.

Calculate trip duration.

Clean data (handle outliers, missing values).

Write the processed data back to the processed S3 bucket, partitioned by year and month.

Containerize the Python script using a Dockerfile.

Extend the Terraform configuration to provision:

Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) to store the Docker image.

AWS Fargate cluster and task definition to run the container.

AWS Glue crawler to catalog the schema of the processed data.

Update the CI/CD pipeline to build and push the Docker image to ECR upon code changes.

Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Athena
Objective: Query the processed data to understand patterns and inform the ML model.

Tasks:

Add an AWS Athena Workgroup and Database to the Terraform configuration.

Run the Glue crawler on the processed data bucket to populate the Athena table schema.

Write and execute SQL queries (analysis.sql) in the Athena query editor to explore:

Average trip duration by time of day.

Most popular pickup/dropoff locations.

Correlation between payment type and tip amount.

Phase 4: Machine Learning Model Development
Objective: Train and deploy a model to predict trip duration.

Tasks:

Add Amazon SageMaker resources to Terraform (e.g., Notebook Instance, Model, Endpoint Configuration).

Create a Jupyter Notebook in SageMaker.

In the notebook:

Load the processed data from S3 into a Pandas DataFrame.

Perform feature engineering (e.g., extracting hour from timestamp, calculating trip distance).

Split data into training and testing sets.

Train a Scikit-learn regression model (e.g., RandomForestRegressor).

Evaluate model performance (RMSE, RÂ²).

Deploy the trained model to a SageMaker endpoint.

Phase 5: Visualization with Amazon Managed Grafana
Objective: Create interactive dashboards for business users.

Tasks:

Add an Amazon Managed Grafana workspace resource to your Terraform configuration.

From the AWS console, configure the Athena plugin within your Grafana workspace as a data source.

Build at least three dashboards:

Rider Demand: A map visualization showing pickup hotspots based on location coordinates, filterable by time of day. (Note: May require a specific Grafana map plugin).

Fare Distribution: A histogram showing the distribution of total fares.

Tipping Behavior: A bar chart comparing average tip percentage across different payment types (credit_card, cash).
